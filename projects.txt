Most Public life sentences



Or somewhat handwritten llm



Try to make important llm decisions as understandable as possible?



Feel like I have to add a question mark to everything it's not the end of the world to act like it's probably already there is it?



Variable grammar, match as many other language grammar orders as possible? 



Use intel's intergalactic radio to ask aliens to help us protect ourselves from maga



I know I can feel someone else laughing bc I've already seen that corgi picture 



Amused by characterization of discomfort? 



Characterize commonly traveled latent space movements? 



Someone close to Greg amused by Greg noticing how someone might interpret picture first



Could feel drop in spirit? Some kind of change maybe. That doesn't totally make sense for what Greg knows about that picture. Not sure how important this is. Just not allowed to sleep or something and maybe typing this will let me sleep.



Get this notion that my thoughts cause horrors that I can't imagine and may not understand in others experiences and now I'm supposed to talk them out of it or something. Just not sure why me staying awake right now is so necessary.



Why can't I sleep upstairs? 



Most justified timelines toward key biophilic technologies



Help aliens map electromagnetic fields by documenting electric device use and positions, more precise incoming transmissions

These questions for public, not so much whoever is bouncing them back at me



Or if public answer us no, maybe find out why not



Detailed public funding priorities



Facilitate liquid democracy



Recycling plastic prob more imp than super precise particle physics. Unless reasonably feasible path from particle physics to plastic recycling with good roi. Bacteria or fungi eating plastic seems a lot closer atm in Greg's opinion.



Most democratic stable coin. Try to find terms that lots of people are likely to trust. Tie to earth resources? And desired work. Bountied work. 



More nimble govt



People will trust Intel leadership/employees the more they can see they are making an honest effort at improving world



Auto dj that quiets when leaving room



Next Gen house experiments



Define desired expertise trajectories, try to create as personalized degree as possible for own knowledge



Send aliens as much detail about where to find the consoles (quantum computers?) we are hosting for them and how they can interact with them. Share ideas for most likely galactic radio designs.



Stable coin that tries to avoid anonymity as much as possible. Terms for trusting someone is real. Lots of clearly non-Ai videos with detailed body and location information, support from other people met in real life. Documentation of unique work as validation of humanity.



Employees first for refining bounty pitches? Narrowing down list? 



Develop bkms for deprecating CEOs

 Leadership teams personally detail most useful heuristics for their job

Train ai to be CEO, see which can generate more persuasive arguments. Employees/public vs ceo. Or collab with ceo. 



dogfood teaching ai own job



Stablecoin like with ubi. Everyone gets enough for shelter, food, water, Healthcare. Start with very scary stakes? See how much you can guarantee eventually with greater understanding of how useful bounties work out. Move from relying on living on usd to living on democratic stablecoin. 



Optimize Ai energy usage



More interpretation of Ai methods, condensing into something more handwritten



Ai that better matches available tools, more x86/gpu code. Not all matrix math

More widely visible/understandable scientific debate. Normal people need to be able to decide where they want to spend bounty coin. 

Publicize intel's own resource usage (materials, energy) with as much detail as possible. Develop, share bkms for other companies to do the same. Move toward letting world decide how resources should be allocated.
