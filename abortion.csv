premise,comments
a fetus is more separate from the mother than other collections of cells inside her body,
"state should limit itself to forcing most minimal sacrifices, not exceptionally great sacrifices of free will like enduring pregnancy",more heuristic for policymaking than provable cause-effect
"the more significant a societally-forced sacrifice, the higher the likelihood of unnecessary suffering",
not comfortable with any government-forced manipulation on a decision with such a localized area of effect	,
my personal focus with regards to abortion is to avoid inducing a pregnancy that is likely to end in an abortion,
I should accept possibility of being a parent when risking pregnancy,
I should not assume the potential mother is comfortable with enduring pregancy,
abortion bans are likely to restrict access to necessary healthcare,define necessary?
