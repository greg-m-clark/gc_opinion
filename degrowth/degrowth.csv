"in the context of environment and economic policy, ""degrowth"" is a perspective that argues against ""green growth""",,
"""degrowth"" is a misleading name because the focus is on reducing material and energy footprint to sustainable levels while being agnostic toward GDP growth",,
reducing resource use to sustainable levels is likely to result in GDP stagnation or contraction,,
GDP growth is not necessarily a good metric for health of economy,,
degrowth is likely necessary for sustainability,,
wellness metrics that consider access to human needs are better measures of health of economy,"which ones, how to improve ones available. Quantify broadness of completing Maslow's pyramid?",
lifestyles of wealthier individuals tend to place a higher burden on environment and human labor,,
capping individual wealth would enable more people to meet their needs,,
capping individual wealth would be more sustainable for the environment,,
requiring minimum lifetimes for appliances would be more sustainable,,
requiring index fund shareholders have voting rights instead of index fund managers would be more sustainable	,,
