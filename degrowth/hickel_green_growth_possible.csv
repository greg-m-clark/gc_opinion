"absolute decoupling of GDP from resource use may be possible in
the short term in some rich nations with strong abatement policy, but only assuming theoretical
efficiency gains that may be impossible to achieve in reality",
"absolute decoupling of GDP from resource use s not feasible on a global scale,
even under best-case scenario policy conditions",
"absolute decoupling of GDP from resource use  is physically impossible to maintain in the
longer term",
"green growth could be accomplished at very low GDP growth rates, i.e. less than 1 per cent per year – significantly lower than historical trends and projected pathways",
using aggregate material footprint without differentiating between impacts of different resources could be a significant shortcoming in argument,meta on paper methods
indefinite growth of any material category on Earth is not currently possible,
GDP growth should only be a goal if it can be decoupled from CO2 emisions,
from 200 to 2014 there has been no decoupling of GDP growth and CO2 emissions,
1.5°C scenario is highly unlikely without degrowth,
