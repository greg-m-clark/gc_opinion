calling a country a democracy does not imply it is upholding democratic values to the best that it can		
US could do a much better job of adhering to democratic values		
well-implmented democracy diminishes unjust power in hierarchies		
US closer to a plutocracy or oligarchy in practice 		
liquid democracy would be closer to adhering to democratic values than representative democracy		
the difference between public opinion poll results on policy and actual enacted policy is a good indicator of how far a government is from adhering to democratic values		
"US opinion polls tend to support more 'mutual aid'-like policies than are enacted"		
enacted polices tend to differ from public opinion poll results in that they favor wealthy minority more		
"main metrics (other word?) to maximize in democracy are ability for population to fully express their concerns, space to exchange ideas, for government to address them. How broadly and deeply opinions are known"	prob needs revision/clarification	
liquid democracy enables a more precise understanding of population's beliefs than representative democracy		
		
more distributed/anarchistic control enables policies to better match preferences of population they apply to relative to centralized control	"prob need detailed data on how to quantify, how to determine what ideal balance is"	
legalization and informed consent enables more freedom than regulations that can ban	"too vague, restrictions on applicability? How to decide how much concentration of violent power is desirable to ban?"	
		
"humans good by default, but trauma and maladaptive coping mechanism tend to cause more suffering than is necessary"		
		
"better to treat vote as a strategy, not a ""this person most closely aligns with my ideology"" checkbox. Was thinking of voting Green vs Democratic in purple states"		
"better to aim for practical change given current conditions, rather than shooting for utopic ideal first and only"		
a lot of baby steps in policy more likely to happen than a big jump		
still good to articulate what utopic end game would look like and why even when focusing on practical baby steps		
better to focus on actions available to self rather than using force to make others change		
		
better for population served by police to set police policies than the police themselves		
"should be population's choice to have stricter police policies, even it means it is harder to hire"		
policing favors wealthier class		
encouraging police to doubt/ignore policies set by superiors better than saying ACAB		
saying ACAB likely to alienate possible allies		
		
GDP growth agnosticism necessary for sustainability		
GDP growth not necessarily a good metric for health of economy		
wellness metrics that consider access to needs better measure of health of economy	"which ones, how to improve ones available. Quantify broadness of completing Maslow's pyramid?"
