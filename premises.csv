calling a country a democracy does not imply it is upholding democratic values to the best that it can		
US could do a much better job of adhering to democratic values		
a well-implemented democracy diminishes unjust power in hierarchies		
US closer to a plutocracy or oligarchy in practice 		
liquid democracy would be closer to adhering to democratic values than representative democracy		
the difference between public opinion poll results on policy and actual enacted policy is a good indicator of how far a government is from adhering to democratic values		
US opinion polls tend to support more 'mutual aid'-like policies than are enacted		
enacted polices tend to differ from public opinion poll results in that they favor wealthy minority more		
main metrics (other word?) to maximize in democracy are ability for population to fully express their concerns, space to exchange ideas, for government to address them. How broadly and deeply opinions are known	prob needs revision/clarification	
more representatives enables more precise repressentation of population's beliefs		
liquid democracy enables a more precise understanding of population's beliefs than representative democracy		
it is possible for a democracy to make mistakes, but is more likely to fix mistakes in a sustainable way than in less democratic governments		
		
more distributed/anarchistic control enables policies to better match preferences of population they apply to relative to centralized control	prob need detailed data on how to quantify, how to determine what ideal balance is	
legalization and informed consent enables more freedom than regulations that can ban	too vague, restrictions on applicability? How to decide how much concentration of violent power is desirable to ban?	
		
humans good by default, but maladaptive coping mechanisms tend to cause more suffering than is necessary		
		
"better to treat vote as a strategy, not a ""this person most closely aligns with my ideology"" checkbox. Was thinking of voting Green vs Democratic in purple states"		
better to aim for practical change given current conditions, rather than shooting for utopic ideal first and only		
a lot of baby steps in policy more likely to happen than a big jump		
still good to articulate what utopic end game would look like and why even when focusing on practical baby steps		
better to focus on actions available to self rather than using force to make others change		
change that works with natural human behavior is more sustainable and kinder than using force to fight against it		
		
conception seems like most logical point at which to say there is definitely a different person/soul is when it has its own unique geometry/behavior	more metaphysical feeling than provable	
state should limit itself to forcing most minimal sacrifices, not exceptionally great sacrifices of free will like enduring pregnancy	more heuristic for policymaking than provable cause-effect	
maximum sentence for abortion should be a philosophy class on metaphysical possibilities and strategies for deciding own philosophy		
		
restorative justice results in lower recidivism rates than retributive justice		
retributive justice is more expensive than restorative/trasformative justice		
retributive justice is not necessary		
keeping offenders alive and studying factors that led to crime is more useful than putting them to death		
		
better for population served by police to set police policies than the police themselves		
should be population's choice to have stricter police policies, even it means it is harder to hire		
current policing favors wealthier class		
encouraging police to doubt/ignore policies set by superiors better than saying ACAB		
saying ACAB likely to alienate possible allies		
		
GDP growth agnosticism is necessary for sustainability		
GDP growth is not necessarily a good metric for health of economy		
wellness metrics that consider access to human needs are better measures of health of economy	which ones, how to improve ones available. Quantify broadness of completing Maslow's pyramid?	
lifestyles of wealthier individuals tend to place a higher burden on environment and human labor		
capping individual wealth would enable more people to meet their needs		
capping individual wealth would be more sustainable for the environment		
requiring minimum lifetimes for appliances would be more sustainable		
requiring index fund shareholders have voting rights instead of index fund managers would be more sustainable		
		
current patent system gives too much power to large corporations		
end game for patent system would be to not have one, people would have the resources they need to do what they are interested in and society approves of		
		
persuasion more likely when asking why someone believes something than telling them beliefs are wrong		
"persuasion more likely when personal beliefs are framed with ""I believe"" rather than ""you should"""		
sharing my beliefs allows others to point out gaps in my reasoning or find gaps in their own		
people are less likely to be vitriolic toward people they know		
sharing my confidence level in a belief and what would make confidence go up or down can help clarify the belief		
persuasion is possible by pointing out opportunities for more nuance		
persuasion is more likely when avoiding extremes like always or never		
persuasion is more likely when slightly opening up a different perspective rather than pushing for complete opposite side of spectrum		
support from a community sometimes feels more important than agreeing with community's ideology		
it is possible to persuade people to leave a harmful community by showing they can get similar support elsewhere		
a small subset (or one person) may have a good point and their unique combination of experiences enables them to explain it in a uniquely intuitive way to someone else		
		
the more worker-owned a company is (as oposed to capitalist-owned), the more robust it tends to be		
companies with fewer working hours per employee tend to be more robust		
		
giving more money to the poor to enable them to fix the problems they believe are highest priority is a better strategy than centralized government planning on their behalf		
		
best strategy to end homelessness is to treat housing as a right and build more housing 		
		
all participation in war should be voluntary		
"if ""not enough"" people are signing up to fight, then it means the cause and/or strategy is not sufficiently justified"		
		
society's fundamental goal should be to enable as many people as possible to reach self-actualization/transcendence in Maslow's pyramid
