a well-implemented democracy diminishes unjust power in hierarchies,,
US closer to a plutocracy or oligarchy in practice ,,
liquid democracy would be closer to adhering to democratic values than representative democracy,,
the difference between public opinion poll results on policy and actual enacted policy is a good indicator of how far a government is from adhering to democratic values,,
US opinion polls tend to support more 'mutual aid'-like policies than are enacted,,
enacted polices tend to differ from public opinion poll results in that they favor wealthy minority more,,
"main metrics (other word?) to maximize in democracy are ability for population to fully express their concerns, space to exchange ideas, for government to address them. How broadly and deeply opinions are known",prob needs revision/clarification,
more representatives enables more precise repressentation of population's beliefs,,
liquid democracy enables a more precise understanding of population's beliefs than representative democracy,,
liquid democracy makes corruption much more expensive,,
"it is possible for a democracy to make mistakes, but is more likely to fix mistakes in a sustainable way than in less democratic governments",,
